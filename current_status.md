# TTS/STT Benchmarking Dashboard - Project Status

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a comprehensive **TTS (Text-to-Speech) and STT (Speech-to-Text) Benchmarking Dashboard** that enables organizations to:

- **Compare multiple vendors** (ElevenLabs, Deepgram, AWS Polly/Transcribe) objectively
- **Measure key performance metrics** including Word Error Rate (WER), latency, accuracy, and confidence scores
- **Support two testing modes**: 
  - **Isolated Mode**: Test TTS and STT separately to isolate quality issues
  - **Chained Mode**: Test complete TTS → STT pipeline for real-world performance
- **Provide comprehensive testing options**: Single text input, batch testing with predefined scripts, and CSV upload
- **Store and track historical results** for trend analysis and vendor comparison over time
- **Export reports** to guide vendor selection decisions for production systems

### Business Value
- Reduce vendor lock-in risk through comparative analysis
- Optimize costs by identifying best-performing solutions
- Improve quality through data-driven vendor selection
- Enable objective evaluation of speech technology vendors
