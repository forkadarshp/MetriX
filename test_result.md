# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "FINAL COMPREHENSIVE TRANSCRIPT VALIDATION COMPLETE! ✅ All 4 specific review request tests passed with 100% success rate. VALIDATION SUMMARY: (1) Isolated TTS run (mode=isolated, service=tts, vendors=elevenlabs): Creates transcript files, API returns HTTP 200 + non-empty text, files exist on disk ✅ (2) Isolated STT run (mode=isolated, service=stt, vendors=deepgram): Same transcript file behavior verified ✅ (3) Chained run (mode=chained, vendors=elevenlabs,deepgram): Transcript file and API behavior confirmed ✅ (4) /api/runs structure unchanged: No regressions, all required fields present ✅. PER-ITEM RESULTS: All run_item_ids produce accessible transcript files via GET /api/transcript/transcript_{run_item_id}.txt with HTTP 200 status and meaningful content. Physical files exist in backend/storage/transcripts/ directory. Frontend Show Transcript button will work for all items across all modes. Transcript feature is fully production-ready and consistently working across isolated TTS, isolated STT, and chained modes!"

    message: "USER REVIEW REQUEST TRANSCRIPT TESTING COMPLETE! ✅ All focused transcript tests passed with 100% success rate. SPECIFIC VALIDATION: (1) Isolated TTS Mode: Text → ElevenLabs TTS → Deepgram STT evaluation → Transcript storage working perfectly. System converts user input 'This is a comprehensive test...' to TTS using ElevenLabs, tests with Deepgram STT for evaluation (88% similarity), saves transcript properly, makes available via /api/transcript/{filename} ✅ (2) Isolated STT Mode: Text → ElevenLabs TTS → Selected STT vendor → Transcript storage working perfectly. System converts user input to TTS using default ElevenLabs, tests with selected STT vendor (Deepgram, 94% similarity), saves transcript properly, makes available via /api/transcript/{filename} ✅ (3) All required metrics generated correctly: TTS mode has tts_latency, audio_duration, wer, accuracy, confidence; STT mode has stt_latency, wer, accuracy, confidence, audio_duration ✅ (4) Transcript files accessible and content matches database ✅. Fixed missing dependencies. Transcript functionality working exactly as user requested for both isolated modes."
